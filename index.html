        <h1>Tate's SSP: Download</h1>
        <p>My Senior Signature Project consists in part of a much-needed upgrade to the Vernier company's <a href="https://www.vernier.com/product/logger-pro-3/">Logger Pro</a> software. The objective of this project is to provide, free of charge, software with similar capabilities to their most recent paid graphical analysis tools, as well to as incorporate more up-to-date data analysis tools such as time-series predictive modeling, machine learning, and user-defined scripts. I also hope to make this software straightforward to use, integrate it with cloud-based collaboration tools, and allow for easy modification of its functionality by editing source code (written in Python).</p>
        <br>
        <p>This software is currently an early prototype, with only the most basic elements in place. Please feel free to download and test this proof of concept below.</p>

        <p>The source code will be uploaded to this GitHub repository shortly.</p>
